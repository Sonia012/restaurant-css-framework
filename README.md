I did this project in Janaury 2019, during the 1st month of my BeCode.org training. The purpose was to make a website for a (fictional) restaurant franchise. We needed to have:
* a homepage with a Jumbotron and 2 cards,
* a "Menu" page including the restaurant's menu, 
* a picture gallery, including pagination, with at least 10 pictures and 3 pictures per page,
* a "Restaurants" page with the address, a map and opening hours for at least 2 restaurants,
* and a Contact page with a contact form asking for the name & family name, e-mail, drop-down list, and a text box to write a message. It also needed to have a Font-awesome - send button.

The site had to:
* be responsive for the smallest and medium size screens,
* have the same navigation bar on every page.
